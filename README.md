## PiNAS

The NasPy project is designed to create a web-based dashboard that integrates automation, data visualization, and smart network attached storage and file management on the Raspberry Pi. It enables local control of connected devices, facilitating sensor automation to monitor environmental conditions and automate responses. Users can manage files—uploading, downloading, and viewing various formats—without needing the internet, with access across multiple devices on the local network. The NAS allows for running Jupyter Notebooks and executing scripts directly from the dashboard, enhancing functionality. Security is ensured through a two-tier user authentication system, and the system is designed to automatically start on boot for continuous availability. Overall, NAS empowers users to efficiently monitor and automate their environments, providing an innovative solution for personal and professional use.
